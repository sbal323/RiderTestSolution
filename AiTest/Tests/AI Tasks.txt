About the classification learning algorithm
------------------------------
Classification is a machine learning algorithm that uses data to determine the category, type, or class of an item or row of data. For example, you can use classification to:

Identify sentiment as positive or negative.
Classify email as spam, junk, or good.
Determine whether a patient's lab sample is cancerous.
Categorize customers by their propensity to respond to a sales campaign.
Classification algorithms are frequently one of the following types:

Binary: either A or B.
Multiclass: multiple categories that can be predicted by using a single model.
